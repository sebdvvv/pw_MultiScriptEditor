This is a cross application, cross platform and open source Python editor, which can be run as a standalone application
or embedded in another application. The main purpose for integration - the ability to script in Python.

### Key features

  - Preserve and load of tabs and code in them
  - Interactive execute of the selected code by pressing Ctrl + Enter
  - Adjust the color theme of the code editor
  - Code completion (module [jedi](https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi))
  - Context completion for different functions like existing nodes and path in scene

### Existing integration modules
  - Blender 5+ (requires PySide6)
  - Houdini 19+
  - Nuke 15+
  - Maya 2024+
  - Gaffer (native dockable Editor; tested 1.6+ / PySide6)

If necessary, you can extend this to make your own integration module.
The main pre condition - Should be used Python 3+.


### Houdini features
  - Code completion for all modules and return types (remastered hou library)
  - Context completion for functions CreateNode, CreateInputNode and CreateOutputNode with existing houdini node types
  - Context completion string for absolute houdini internal path and node parameters. To use this complete start string with "/ or '/
  - Drag&Drop Houdini nodes and parameters fills in their path. Use Alt modifier to wrap node or parameter as code like in Houdini Python Shell.
  - Reading and writing to PythonSOP code and asset sections

### Nuke features
  - Code completion for all modules and return types (remastered nuke library)
  - Context completion for createNode with existing Nuke node types
  - Context completion for function toNode with existing nodes in current script
  - Converting selected nodes to code with function nuke.toNode
  - Searching and converting nodes to code from clipboard
  - Reading and writing from PythonKnobs code

### Maya features
  - Save code to shelf and accept dropped shelf button code, like default Maya script editor
  - Drag&Drop Maya nodes fills in their names. Use Alt modifier to wrap node as code. Import PyMEL before doing this!
  - Context completion for function PyNode with existing nodes in current scene
  - Context completion for function pm.createNode and cmds.createNode with existing Maya node types


### Gaffer features
  - Native dockable panel: Window -> Multi Script Editor
  - Namespace like the built-in Python Editor: `root`, `Gaffer`, `GafferUI`, `IECore`, `imath`
  - Graph edits wrapped in `Gaffer.UndoScope` + the editor context
  - `root['...']` completion and Alt-drop path wrapping

# How to install

[Standalone](readme_standalone.md)
[Houdini](readme_houdini.md)
[Maya](readme_maya.md)
[Nuke](readme_nuke.md)
[Gaffer](readme_gaffer.md)

You can use single module installation for each case. Just extract module `multi_script_editor`
to somewhere (no spaces and non ascii characters in path) and add this path to PYTHONPATH before start your app.

For example:

Extract to `'/home/username/myscripts/multi_script_editor'`

Add this path to PYTHONPATH environment variable

Windows:

`set PYTHONPATH=c:/users/username/myscripts`

Linux

`export PYTHONPATH=/home/username/myscripts`

Python

`os.environ['PYTHONPATH'] = '/home/username/myscripts'`

Do this for each app.
